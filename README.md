# Movie_creature_symfony

just after starting ur server using symfony server:start 
you will automaticly go to symfony first page on 127.0.0.1/8000
whant i want you to do is to add /movies to go the project so your url will be 127.0.0.1/8000/movies 

in this project you can create , edit , delete , view movies but first to get the auth to do the editing and deleting something you must first register -
and then login .
